# Local Services Platform

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Local Services Platform is a full-stack web application designed to connect users seeking various local services (e.g., plumbing, cleaning, tutoring) with qualified service providers. The platform facilitates service discovery, booking, payment, and real-time communication, aiming to streamline the process of finding and offering local expertise.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the project's architecture, technologies, and functionality.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend (React.js SPA) and the backend (Node.js/Express API). Communication between the two is primarily via RESTful API calls, supplemented by WebSocket (Socket.IO) for real-time features.

### Frontend Structure

The React application is organized into `components` for reusable UI elements and `pages` for full-view components, managed by `react-router-dom`.

/client
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets        # Local frontend assets (logos, icons)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components    # Reusable UI elements (Navbar, Modals, Buttons)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts      # React Context for global state (AuthContext)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks         # Custom React Hooks
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages         # Main application views (HomePage, LoginPage, ChatPage)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services      # API service calls
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils         # Utility functions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js        # Main application component, routing setup
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js      # React app entry point
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...


### Backend Structure

The Express.js backend is structured into standard modules for clarity and maintainability.

/server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config            # Database connection, environment setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers       # Business logic for API endpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cron              # Scheduled tasks (e.g., reminderJobs.js)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware        # Authentication, authorization, error handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models            # Mongoose schemas for MongoDB
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes            # API endpoint definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js         # Main server file, app initialization, Socket.IO setup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
